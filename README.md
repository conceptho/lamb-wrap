# Lamb-Wrap Î»ðŸŒ¯

## Description
Lamb-wrap is a node module designed for AWS Lambda that wraps the complexity over authentication, permission and model loading and returns a ready to use lambda handler to
be used both at plain [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/details/) or into the [Serverless Framework](http://serverless.com/).

The way lamb-wrap works

## Example

## Documentation

### Instalation

### Usage
We're still trying to figure out what will come into this repo. But our initial goal is to have some sort of entrypoint to wrap lambda functions with permissions over resources and attributes.

Once we have a clear idea of what this will be, we'll definitively write a good description/docs.
